## Theater-related Campaigns
As mentioned above, theater-related projects were the vast majority of our Kickstarter campaign data.

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month of May contained the most successful launches of theater-related Kickstarters, with March and September tying for the number of least successful launches.

### Theater-related Campaigns in the US
The mean goal of successful US theater campaigns was $5,049, with a mean pledged amount of $5,602. Successful US theater campaigns had a median goal of $3,000, with a median pledged amount of $3,168.
The mean goal of failed US theater campaigns was $10,554, with a mean pledged amount of $559. Failed US theater campaigns had a median goal of $5,000, with a median pledged amount of $103. This data tells us that there are reasons other than financial that led to the failure of some Kickstarter campaigns.

## Musical Campaigns in Great Britain
For musical campaigns in Great Britain, the mean goal was £4,000, with a mean pledged amount of about £1,000.

## Recommendations
Theater-related Kickstarters have proved to show the most success as far as category is concerned, and in the US, sticking to a goal near the mean of $5,049 could yield success. Launching the Kickstarter in May could lead to greater success as well. If considering launching a musical campaign in Great Britain, you might want to focus your goal somewhere near the mean pledged amount of £1,000.
